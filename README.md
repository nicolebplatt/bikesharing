# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and interpret Citi Bike data from New York City to determine if a similar program could be adopted in Des Moines.

## Results
There are significantly more subscribers than customers who use CitiBikes.

Top starting locations appear to be in lower Manhattan and midtown.

People appear to end trips mostly in lower Manhattan and midtown.

As expected, peak hours of bike usage correspond with morning and evening commutes.

Most trips last less than one hour.

The most popular trip duration for males was 5 minutes but 6 minutes for females.

Most bike rentals occur during peak commute times (8-9AM and 5-7PM).

While there are more males who take bike trips, patterns of daily and hourly usage are similar regardless of gender.

Subscribers appear to prefer to rent bikes on weekdays while customers appear to prefer weekend bike rentals.


## Summary
Based on the results of this analysis, a pilot program in Des Moines might prove to be successful. Some things of note:
1. There are significantly more men who rented bikes in New York than women.
2. There are significantly more subscribers (annual membership) than customers (24-hour or 3-day pass).
3. The age data seems to be incorrect or needs additional cleaning since many riders indicated a birth year in the 1800s.

Some additional visualizations I might perform with this dataset would be comparing start time and start station in order to get a better sense of which stations get the most traffic depending on time of day. This analysis might be more useful than the peak hours analysis which identified 1-4AM as opportune repair times. A more detailed analysis might inform us when and from where our bikes should be repaired.

Another visualization might be to compare start location to end location and determine how far bikes are being ridden instead of how long. This might also help identify bikes in need of repair. For example, if someone rented a bike for 15 minutes, we can't tell currently if they were riding for the full 15 minutes or if they rode somewhere, took a break or picked something up, and started riding again.
